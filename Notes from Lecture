Time Series Forecasting
        -Predict future based off of historical trends

ONe thing he doesn't typically talk about is model maintenance, etc

Traditional forecasting methodologies focuson univariate cases, don;t learn from multiple examples at once 
Most ML afre fantastic at dealing with multiple features (boosted, tree absed,e tc)

HOw could you handle different seasonalities?
See slide: Target Differences
  Intentionally bake in seasonality - focus only what's difference year aftter year 
  Specifically around holiday, people will put alot of effort into feature engineering, especially around known events
          Can create freatures and feed into model (Black Friday, Thanksgiving, etc)

Time-Series - can mean different things to different people
    Ex: EKG (using it for pattern recognition, even though it is a time based)
    
    
Other times too, people are talking about independent event data     

Question: Do we still bother with models like ARIMA, etc? 

Question: How do you incorooprate known information?
Could possibly treat as target transformation
In general for ML, it can be difficult to incorporate known diverse sets of information 


Why are time series problems different? 
CA #1: Order doesn't matter (it does)
CA #2: TRaining and future data are similar 
CA #3: Models can be evaluated with a single row of data

>>>>>>>>The four sections of Time Series Forecasting Process:
                        Feature Engineering - What are different featurs I can use? 
                                                How do you seaerch for some of these features
                        Target Transformation - Different season strategies
                        Model Backtesting - Refit on most recent data 
                                        Q: WHat if limited data around events? 
                                                       A: Focus validation on period of interest; ex: holidays - so validate just during the holidays 
                                                       A: You can build in indexes 
                        Modeling - 

>>>>>>>General Time Series Framewrok (see photos)
        -Alot of times have really tight busienss constraints, need to forecast for next week but don't know this week's sales
        - Might not care about 1 day prediction when you care about 7-14 days
        
>>>>>>Time Series Modeling Families:

                        INtegrated Models-Predictions feeding more predictions
                                     -Per time basis modeling 

                        Trends and Decomposition Models - 
                                -tbats, arima fore-8 trends
