ONe thing he doesn't typically talk about is model maintenance, etc

Traditional forecasting methodologies focuson univariate cases, don;t learn from multiple examples at once 
Most ML afre fantastic at dealing with multiple features (boosted, tree absed,e tc)

HOw could you handle different seasonalities?
See slide: Target Differences
  Intentionally bake in seasonality - focus only what's difference year aftter year 
  Specifically around holiday, people will put alot of effort into feature engineering, especially around known events
          Can create freatures and feed into model (Black Friday, Thanksgiving, etc)

Time-Series - can mean different things to different people
    Ex: EKG (using it for pattern recognition, even though it is a time based)
    
    
Other times too, people are talking about independent event data
